# Compare Golang channelsÂ withC# BlockingCollection & Threads

Don't do this; i.e. don't use channels and functions to create collections. It's the wrong use of concurrecy; This contrived example is shown here so that we can have some insights to compare channels to C# BlockingCollection and Threads. Typically this might be an expensive operation, calculateExpensiveFoo. I've not used long names in the example below, because the code doesnt fit in side by side when i do! Please use your imagination. ðŸ˜‡

This is a draft : Still need to add to the bottom where this pattern goes horribly wrong (deadlocks)and how to fix it (improve) the code in both C# and Go. Real Go advantages start to kick in with select. Need to add that below.

    <ul>
        <li>Goroutines are much more lightweigh than a thread. 1 Thread per multiple goroutines.
		<li>Goroutines are more optimal use less memory. Not an advantage in trivial examples but is serious when you're storing and creating hundreds of collections.
		<li>defer guarantees the channel closes, and doesnt cause extra indenting that makes code harder to read. Many cases are simply 1 liners.
		<li>Code does need to be modified when used asychronously.
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>Each task, uses a thread. 
		<li>Thread per task run is not serious in this example, but could become an issue if we needed 1000 collections.
		<li>return type and code needs to change if you want to call this code using async.
    </ul>
