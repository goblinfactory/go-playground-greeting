# random things about go 

Random thoughts about go, from 4 C# developers - initial thoughts after first impressions with some learning.

*   `9.11.21 [ @A ]`

    *I like that even if your code has the incorrect number of arguments to a function, you can always press F12 from VSCode and go straight to the implementation. In C# if you have the wrong arguments, the compiler wont go anywhere since there's no matching overloaded function. Go can only ever have 1 definition for a function, so F12 always knows where to go irrespective of what parameters you are calling the func with.*

    *I think part of the reason we've been enjoying go is that it's pretty much just notepad and a terminal window (albeit via VSCode or Goland). It's back to basics and it's fun!*
